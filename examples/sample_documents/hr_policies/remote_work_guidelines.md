# Remote Work Guidelines

## Purpose

This policy establishes guidelines for employees working remotely to ensure productivity and work-life balance.

## Eligibility

Remote work is available to employees whose job functions can be performed remotely. Eligibility is determined by the employee's manager in consultation with HR.

## Work Hours

Remote employees are expected to maintain regular working hours (9 AM - 5 PM local time) and be available for meetings and collaboration during core business hours.

## Equipment and Technology

The company will provide:
- Laptop computer
- Monitor (upon request)
- Necessary software licenses

Employees are responsible for:
- Maintaining a reliable internet connection
- Providing a suitable workspace
- Ensuring data security

## Communication Requirements

Remote employees must:
- Attend all required virtual meetings
- Respond to messages within 2 hours during working hours
- Use company-approved communication tools (Slack, Zoom, Email)
- Update their status in the company directory

## Performance Expectations

Remote work does not change performance expectations. Employees are evaluated on deliverables and outcomes, not hours worked.

Managers will conduct regular check-ins (at least weekly) to ensure alignment and address any concerns.
